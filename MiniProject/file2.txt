Motivation
The task of finding nearest neighbours is very common. You can think of applications like finding duplicate or similar documents, audio/video search. Although using brute force to check for all possible combinations will give you the exact nearest neighbour but it’s not scalable at all. Approximate algorithms to accomplish this task has been an area of active research. Although these algorithms don’t guarantee to give you the exact answer, more often than not they’ll be provide a good approximation. These algorithms are faster and scalable.

Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is one such algorithm. LSH has many applications, including:

Near-duplicate detection: LSH is commonly used to deduplicate large quantities of documents, webpages, and other files.
Genome-wide association study: Biologists often use LSH to identify similar gene expressions in genome databases.
Large-scale image search: Google used LSH along with PageRank to build their image search technology VisualRank.
Audio/video fingerprinting: In multimedia technologies, LSH is widely used as a fingerprinting technique A/V data.
